  <p>â€œIt is one thingâ€¦to have very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like this.â€[1] â€“ Emma, Jane Austen</p>

<p>On todayâ€™s menu are the baffling Enigma and the scrumptious Charade â€“ both kinds of Riddle.</p>

<p>An Enigma, as its name implies, is a slightly more complicated Riddle.</p>

<p>Enigmas are riddles â€“ but in poetry form! Check this one out:</p>

<p><em>Learning has bred me â€“ Yet I know not a letter</em></p>

<p><em>I have livâ€™d among books â€“ Yet am never the better</em></p>

<p><em>I have eaten up the muses â€“ Yet know not a Verse</em></p>

<p><em>What student is this â€“ I pray you rehearse.</em></p>

<p>See how it rhymes? Thatâ€™s what makes it an Enigma! The answer to this one is â€˜wormâ€™.*</p>

<p>Another type of riddle we have at Timeless Riddles is the Charade. Charades are similar to the game of charades we play today. In fact, the modern game evolved from the written version[2].</p>

<p>This type of riddle first breaks the solution into parts, the last clue hints at the whole word, which includes the first answers combined. Hereâ€™s an example:</p>

<p><em>My first is equality (match)</em></p>

<p><em>My second inferiority (less)</em></p>

<p><em>My whole superiority (matchless)</em></p>

<p>Two more Charades for practice:</p>

<p><em>I cut my first with my</em></p>

<p><em>second and put my</em></p>

<p><em>whole in my pocket.</em></p>

<p>The answer to the first Charade is â€˜penknifeâ€™. You cut your â€˜penâ€™ (first syllable) with your â€˜knifeâ€™ (second syllable), and can put the â€˜penknifeâ€™ (whole word) in your pocket!</p>

<p><em>My first quite uncivil is often</em></p>

<p><em>times reckonâ€™d,</em></p>

<p><em>a name for each creature</em></p>

<p><em>on earth is my second,</em></p>

<p><em>my whole when united so</em></p>

<p><em>odd will appear</em></p>

<p><em>the coward will fight me,</em></p>

<p><em>the hero will fear.</em></p>

<p>The answer to the second is â€˜nothingâ€™. â€˜Noâ€™ (first syllable) is considered uncivil, a name for each creature is â€˜thingâ€™ (second syllable), and the coward will fight â€˜nothingâ€™, just as the hero will fear â€˜nothingâ€™ (whole word)!</p>

<p>Did you get them both? Now that you have all gotten the hang of it, try these on your own:</p>

<p>One Enigma:</p>

<p><em>A Riddle of riddles, it dances &amp; skips</em></p>

<p><em>It is seen throâ€™ the eyes thoâ€™ it cheats by the Lips.</em></p>

<p><em>It never is seen, but often is read</em></p>

<p><em>It is sometimes a feather, &amp; sometimes â€˜tis Lead.</em></p>

<p><em>If it meets with its Fellow â€“ its happily caught</em></p>

<p><em>But if money can buy it-its not worth a groat.</em></p>

<p>And one Charade:</p>

<p><em>My first is a Preposition,</em></p>

<p><em>My second is a Composition</em></p>

<p><em>My Whole â€“ is an acquisition.</em></p>

<p>Can you solve them? Tune in next time for the answers and more Timeless Riddles!</p>
