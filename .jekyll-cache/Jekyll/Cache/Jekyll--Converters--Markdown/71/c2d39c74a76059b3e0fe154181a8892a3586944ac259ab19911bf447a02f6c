<p>Timeless Riddles is back with some more puzzling problems! Were you able to solve the riddles from last time? The answer to the Enigma is â€˜Heartâ€™. The answer to the Charade is â€˜Fortuneâ€™ (because â€˜forâ€™ is a preposition, â€˜tuneâ€™ is a composition and â€˜fortuneâ€™ is an acquisition!).</p>

<p>On todayâ€™s menu is a different kind of riddle: The spectacular Rebus! The Rebus is a visual puzzle. In order to solve it, you need to decode both words and images.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a classic Rebus from one of Lewis Carrollâ€™s letters:</p>

<p><em>The Chestnuts</em></p>

<p><em>My dear Ina,</em></p>

<p><em>Though I donâ€™t give</em></p>

<p><em>birthday presents, still I</em></p>

<p><em>may write a birthday letter.</em></p>

<p><em>I came to your door to</em></p>

<p><em>wish you many happy returns</em></p>

<p><em>of the day, but the cat met</em></p>

<p><em>me, and took me for a mouse,</em></p>

<p><em>and hunted me up and down</em></p>

<p><em>till I could hardly stand.</em></p>

<p><em>However somehow I got</em></p>

<p><em>into the house, and there</em></p>

<p><em>a mouse met me, and took me</em></p>

<p><em>for a cat, and pelted meâ€¦</em>[2]</p>

<p>See how the letter is comprised of both words and pictures?</p>

<hr />

<p>Some Rebuses emphasize the visual arrangement of their words to hint at their answer:</p>

<p><em>I have to paid</em></p>

<p><em>because</em></p>

<p><em>work I am</em>[3]</p>

<p>Looks funny, right? Thatâ€™s because the way the sentence is presented contributes to its meaning!</p>

<p>The answer is: â€œI have to overwork because I am underpaidâ€.</p>

<p>â€œI have toâ€ is literally over the word â€œworkâ€, and â€œI amâ€ is literally under the word â€œpaidâ€.</p>

<hr />

<p>While the idea of the Rebus originated over five thousand years ago, it gained popularity in England throughout the seventeenth century, especially as heraldic seals[4].</p>

<p>Even the celebrated William Shakespeare is not above such pun-tastic riddles! His very own coat of arms is a Rebus of his name â€“ â€˜Shake-Speareâ€™[5]:</p>

<p>Rebuses can come in many different shapes and forms. How about you try this one for yourselves?</p>

<p><em>Three-fourths of a cross and a circle complete,</em></p>

<p><em>Two semicircles and a perpendicular meet,</em></p>

<p><em>A triangle standing on two feet;</em></p>

<p><em>Two semicircles and a circle complete.</em></p>

<p>Donâ€™t forget that the visual aspect is key! Tune in text time for the solution and more tongue-tying Timeless Riddles!</p>
